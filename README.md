Unity game project trying to clone the famous Pac-Man game

Most of this code was taken of a Youtube channel called "The Weekly Coder" as well as most of the ideas used for making the system of this Pac-Man. I just thought about the systems by myself before jumping into coding and then checkout what a real programmer would do on making this game so all the credit goes for him. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CJuvawxWkB_sDAS9cgktw/about
